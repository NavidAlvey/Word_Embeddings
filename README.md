# GloVe Similarity Tool

This tool allows you to load GloVe word vectors, compute cosine similarity between word pairs, and find the most similar words to a specified word using word embeddings.

## Features

1. **Load GloVe Word Vectors:** Reads pre-trained GloVe embeddings from a file and stores them in a dictionary.
2. **Cosine Similarity Calculation:** Computes similarity scores between word vectors.
3. **Find Similar Words:** Finds the top 5 most similar words to a given word based on cosine similarity.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- `numpy` library

Install `numpy` via pip if you haven't already:
```bash
pip install numpy
